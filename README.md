# Real Time Bus Tracker

### Description
This project demonstrates building a small web app using two different APIs concurrently. It currently tracks all the buses on route 1 in Boston, near Cambridge and the University area. Locations are updated only every 15 seconds so as not to abuse API access.

### How to Run
Currently is not built to be hosted. Simply open the index.html file locally with your browser or visit the [demo](https://maxohsawa.github.io/live-bus-tracker).

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Potentially may allow for user interaction to select buses and trains and pull down respective data for the selection. Would also like to add custom icons for bus and train markers.
